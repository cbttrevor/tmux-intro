## Learning Objectives

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to split your terminal into windows and panes.
You can run tmux on Linux or MacOS, but it doesn't run natively on Windows.
If you're on Windows and want to use tmux, you can use Docker Desktop, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or spin up a remote virtual machine (VM) on a cloud provider.

Tmux allows you to run processes in the background after you've detached from a remote Secure Shell (SSH) session.
GNU screen is another utility that's similar to tmux.
