## Learning Objectives

* Install tmux using your operating system's package manager
* Tmux cannot be installed natively on the Windows platform
* If you need tmux on Windows, the easiest way to run it is with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* You can also use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to spin up a Linux container and run tmux there
  * Using this method, you have the choice of Hyper-V or WSL back-end
