## Learning Objectives

Let's run tmux and learn about some of the basic components of the interface.

* Tmux has a "prefix" key that is used for many shortcuts
* Scrolling in tmux is accomplished using the prefix key + arrows or `PgUp` and `PgDown`
* Splitting panes horizontally and vertically
* Maximize a pane using the `prefix + z` shortcut
* Create new windows with `prefix + c`
* The status bar shows you the active window

Examine the default key bindings using the `<prefix> + ?` keyboard shortcut.
